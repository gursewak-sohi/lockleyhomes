                <h3>Reservation</h3>
                <p>Once you have decided on your new home, the first step will be to meet with your Customer Relationship Manager on site to sign the reservation agreement. You will also be given a copy of our Homebuyer Guide, and sign forms to show that you have also received copies of the Consumer Code for Home Builders, and information about safety on site.</p>

                <h3>Reservation fee</h3>
                <p>A reservation fee of 1% of the property price is payable when you sign the reservation agreement. It will be deducted from your 10% deposit when you exchange contracts. Please note that exchange of contracts must take place within 28 days of signing the reservation agreement, or it expires. In some cases, we can extend this period, but it is at our discretion.</p>

                <h3>Cooling off and cancellations</h3>
                <p>There is a 24-hour cooling-off period after you have paid the reservation fee, during which you will receive a full refund if you change your mind. After that, we will retain 25% of the fee if you cancel the purchase before contracts are issued to the appointed solicitor, to cover our administrative costs. Once contracts have been issued, 50% of the reservation fee will be retained if you decide not to continue with the purchase of your new home.</p>

                <p>Naturally you will be excited to see how your new home is progressing. We can arrange two site visits for you, one during the structural work and another at the pre-decoration stage. During these site visits your safety is paramount and you will be provided with the appropriate protective clothing and accompanied by your Customer Relationship Manager. You will also be given a Safety On Site Notice to sign.</p>

                <h3>Personalising your home</h3>
                <p>We like to give customers the opportunity to personalise their home. Whenever possible we offer choices such as flooring and kitchen worktops, as well as the opportunity to select premium upgrades, all depending on the stage construction has reached. Your Customer Relationship Manager will talk you through these choices when you visit the site.</p>

                <h3>When will your home be ready?</h3>
                <p>The big question! At reservation, we will give you a build completion date. This is the physical completion of your home, not to be confused with legal completion. Please note that the date is only an estimate. We will of course do our best to meet it, but circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather or material shortages, may lead to delays. When the build is complete, the directors will personally carry out the Plot Test to make sure the property complies with all building regulations, meets our stringent standards, and is ready for occupation.</p>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>Buying a home can be a long process, so we appreciate you will want to know how things are progressing. For this, we use a secure online portal called Spaciable, which is tailored to your home. You will have your own login for this. It contains key contact details, FAQs, helpful information, a digital version of your Homeowner’s Manual, and full details of what your new home includes. We can use Spaciable to communicate with you and you with us, both up to and beyond the purchase of your home.</p>

                  It is a really important step as you will be able to confirm that any snagging issues revealed during the home demonstration have been attended to. You will have the opportunity to make a thorough inspection of the property, and if satisfied, sign off the snagging forms.
                  It is also an opportunity to ask questions, and for us to explain all you need to know about the property and how everything functions. We will even make sure the heating is turned on if you wish. Once you are completely satisfied, we hand over the keys and your Homeowner’s Manual ready for you to turn your house in to a home.</p>
